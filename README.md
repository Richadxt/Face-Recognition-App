# Face-Recognition-App
face-recognition-app created using Open-CV, numPy, Face Recognition and Python.
face recognition is a technique to identify or verify the face from the digital images, or Face Recognition is also a method of identifying or verifying the identity of an individual by using their face.

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library, it is supported by different programming languages such as R, Python etc.
OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products.

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python which provides a multidimensional array object other mathematical operations can be performed using this but we just need it to convert our images into some form of an array so that we can store the model that has been trained.
